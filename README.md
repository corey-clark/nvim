# nvim
My NeoVim Complete Setup

- Create a ~/.config directory if you don't already have one
- Inside ~/.config directory pull down the repo
- cd into nvim folder and open it with neovim e.g. nvim command
- Plugins should begin to install automagically.
- You will also need to install Node via NVM for JS related servers to work
- Tip: add the nvm config to a .zshrc file (not .zshenv file)
- If errors occure run :MasonLog to check the error logs
